/*
Problem:
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container holding the most water.

How I thought about it:
The width is maximized at ends, so I tried shrinking the window intelligently.

Approach:
Use two pointers and always move the pointer with smaller height.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
