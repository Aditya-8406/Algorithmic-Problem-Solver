Binary search is an efficient searching technique that works on sorted data.

Instead of checking elements one by one:

We divide the search space in half each time

Decide which half to continue searching in

It reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n) and is also used to solve optimization problems where the answer lies within a range.
