/*
Problem:
Find the index where a target should be inserted in a sorted array.

How I thought about it:
This is almost the same as binary search, except we return the position where the search ends.

Approach:
Perform binary search and return the left pointer when the loop ends.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
