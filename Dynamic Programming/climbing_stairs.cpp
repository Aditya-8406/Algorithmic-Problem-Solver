/*
Problem:
Find the number of ways to reach the top if you can climb 1 or 2 steps.

How I thought about it:
The number of ways to reach a step depends on the previous two steps,
which is exactly the Fibonacci pattern.

Approach:
Use DP to store and reuse results.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
