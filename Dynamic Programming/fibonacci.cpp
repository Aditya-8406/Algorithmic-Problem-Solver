/*
Problem:
Find the nth Fibonacci number.

How I thought about it:
The recursive solution repeats the same calculations many times.
Storing previous results avoids unnecessary work.

Approach:
Use dynamic programming to build values from the bottom up.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
