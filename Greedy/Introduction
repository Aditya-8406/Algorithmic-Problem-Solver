Greedy algorithms work by making the best possible choice at the current step, hoping that these local choices lead to a globally optimal solution.

The key idea is:

If a problem has the property that a locally optimal decision leads to an optimal overall result, a greedy approach will work.

Greedy solutions are usually:

Simple to implement

Very efficient

Based on strong observations or patterns

However, not every problem can be solved greedily, so the challenge is recognizing when greedy logic applies.
