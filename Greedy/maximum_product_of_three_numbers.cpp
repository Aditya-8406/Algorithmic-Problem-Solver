/*
Problem:
Find the maximum product of three numbers in an array.

How I thought about it:
The maximum product can come from either:
- The three largest numbers, or
- Two smallest (negative) numbers and the largest number.

Approach:
Track the largest and smallest values while traversing.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
