/*
Problem:
Find the minimum number of moves to make all array elements equal.

How I thought about it:
Moving all elements to the median minimizes total distance.
This is a greedy observation.

Approach:
Sort the array and move all elements toward the median.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
