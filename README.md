# Algorithmic-Problem-Solver
A curated collection of algorithmic problems solved using efficient data structures and algorithms, focusing on clarity, optimization, and problem-solving fundamentals.
**Overview**
This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved with a focus on clear thinking, efficiency, and readability.

The goal of this repository is not just to provide correct solutions, but to explain the thought process behind each approach, making it easier to understand why a solution works, not just how.

All solutions are written in C++ and organized topic-wise for better clarity.

**📂 Topics Covered**

📌 Arrays

Covers fundamental array manipulation problems such as traversal, rearrangement, prefix logic, and optimization techniques.

📌 Sliding Window

Focuses on problems involving continuous subarrays or substrings, optimized using two pointers and window expansion/shrinking.

📌 Binary Search

Includes classic binary search, binary search on answer, rotated arrays, and 2D matrix search problems.

📌 Stack & Queue

Contains problems based on LIFO and FIFO behavior, including expression evaluation, monotonic stacks, and simulations.

📌 Hashing

Uses hash maps and hash sets for fast lookups, frequency counting, mappings, and optimization of brute-force solutions.

📌 Strings

Covers character processing, pattern matching, validations, and transformations using efficient techniques.

📌 Greedy Algorithms

Includes problems solved by making locally optimal decisions, such as interval handling and resource optimization.

📌 Bit Manipulation

Focuses on binary operations, XOR tricks, and power-based checks for constant-time solutions.

📌 Dynamic Programming

Contains problems solved using overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, turning exponential solutions into efficient ones.
