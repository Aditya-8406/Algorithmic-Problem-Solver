Sliding window is a technique used when working with continuous subarrays or substrings.

Instead of recalculating values for every subarray, we:

Maintain a window using two pointers

Expand the window to include new elements

Shrink it when conditions are violated

This approach reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) in many problems.
