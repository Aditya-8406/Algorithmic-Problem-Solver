A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

Common applications:

Validating expressions

Undo/Redo operations

Parsing problems

Monotonic stack problems

Stacks are useful when the most recent element matters first.

/*    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     */

A queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

It is commonly used in:

Scheduling tasks

Breadth-first search (BFS)

Sliding window optimizations

Real-world simulations (lines, buffers)

Variants like deque and circular queue solve more specialized problems.
