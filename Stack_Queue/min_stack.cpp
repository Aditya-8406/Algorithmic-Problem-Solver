/*
Problem:
Design a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

How I thought about it:
If I store the minimum value at each step, I never lose track of it.

Approach:
Use an auxiliary stack to keep track of minimum values.

Time Complexity: O(1) per operation
Space Complexity: O(n)
