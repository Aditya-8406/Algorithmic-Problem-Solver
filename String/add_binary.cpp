/*
Problem:
Add two binary strings and return the result as a binary string.

How I thought about it:
Binary addition is similar to decimal addition, but with carry limited to 1.

Approach:
Traverse both strings from the end, add digits and carry accordingly.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
