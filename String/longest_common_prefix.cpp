/*
Problem:
Find the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

How I thought about it:
The prefix must be common to all strings, so comparing character by character works.

Approach:
Iterate through characters of the first string and compare with others.

Time Complexity: O(n * m)
Space Complexity: O(1)
