/*
Problem:
Check whether two strings are anagrams of each other.

How I thought about it:
If two strings are anagrams, they must have the same characters with the same frequencies.

Approach:
Count the frequency of each character using a hash map and compare.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
